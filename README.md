A project *template* ntended for use with building simple ATMEGA 328PU 
projects on DIP28 ICs and using the internal 8 MHz clock, which is handy 
for miniature devices and use with custom PCBs.

Crunchysteve's idea is to use 328p chips for functions in, and control
of, guitar effects pedals. While this is open source and free software, 
please drop Crunchy a line if you use it for one of your own projects. 
Structural improvements and contributions welcome from the community.

See LICENCE.md for usage terms. (Project now ready for release. V0.0.0)
